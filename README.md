**Information architecture:**

I value maintaining control over my expenses. To cater to my needs, I have developed a compact app that enables the conversion of Euro to PLN. Provide the exchange rate once, and adjust only if necessary. Enter the expenses now and receive instant results. The results are saved in local storage and can be cleared anytime using a single button.

**Design:**

Top-to-bottom approach aligns with users' natural reading patterns and captures attention right away. App is intuitive to use. Made with the Semantic UI framework.
